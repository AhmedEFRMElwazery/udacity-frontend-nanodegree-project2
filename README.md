## Instructions

This project started as a weather app journel, as specified and stated in the project ruberic of Task 2 in the front-end web development Udacity NanoDegree.

However, ever since I discovered the power of APIs, and the wealth of data and information that they offer, I grew ever more greedy with the project.

I also decided to take advantage of the initiative by Udacity (i.e. to innovate and come up with one's own ideas) that was offered to us during project one (landing page), and I wasn't able to  do so due to the lack of time. Therefore, I decided to go all-in on it for this project.

**Kindly note that all the project requirements as stipulated by Udacity's ruberic has been fulfilled nontheless, and they were integrated, one way or another, to serve the purpose of my app.**

I belive the project now is more of a weather-oriented travel planner, in which the user get to search weather data, and at the same time gets information on available flights from his city to the city (destination) he searched using the **"Awesome Vacation" App**. Yep, that's what I am calling it right now. :laughing:

## Limitations

It is advised that the app is viewed in **"Desktop" mode**, as I have't had the time to apply the principles of responsive design. If you indeed find that the app is already responsive, then I have probably carried on and applied responsive design, but forgot to remove this statement...Sorry!!! :sweat_smile:

You will be prompted by the browser for your geo-location. This is required for the app to work, as it uses your geo-location and the city you have searched to search for available flights from the nearest airports around you.
